    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Welcome to asteroids captain! You need to naviagate the great beyond. Avoid collision with asteroids as they will
    destroy your ship! We only have 3 ships in total, so after that it is over for us. We can only move forward when all the
    asteroid is the current region have been destroyed. Once that happens we will move to the next region
    which will likely have more asteroids.
